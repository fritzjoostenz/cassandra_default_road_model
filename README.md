## Folder: 'dm_setups'
This folder contains the latest as well as earlier versions of the Domain Model Setup file for the Default Road Model. Versions are numbered consequtively so just download the latest version if you do not want to roll back to an earlier version. From Version 2 onwards, each file should contain an incremental change log to show how each version is different from its immediate predecessor. Note that this change log is not cumulative, but only shows changes since the previous version.

## Folder: 'tutorial_projects'
This folder contains Tutorial projects that accompany YouTube videos. Most of these tutorials contain input data sets with 500 or fewer elements, and thus you can follow along without requiring a desktop license.
In the root 'tutorial_projects' folder you should find zip files that accompany each tutorial. Download the zip file and unzip this to a folder on your computer to follow along with YouTube video tutorials.

## Folder: 'demo_projects'
This folder contains Demonstration projects. It is similar to Tutorial projects but not as polished and some files may contain deprecated features etc. Mainly for use by the development team.
